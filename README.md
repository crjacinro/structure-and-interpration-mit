## Setup Used

### Initially, I used the Common Lisp dialect and interpreter but encountered a lot of issues when I reached higher-order procedures because of the differences of the syntax.

### I switched to Scheme and used the [Chicken](https://www.call-cc.org/) compiler since the original book and videos were using Scheme.
